// The device-auth server's hostname is resolved here, internally, through
//   the same DNS1/DNS2 mechanism (and port) the current session is already
//   using -- exactly like the game's own DNS lookups -- rather than being
//   hardcoded independently by every frontend. This means notify() can't
//   fire the callback synchronously: resolution takes real ticks, so it's
//   queued and driven from mobile_device_auth_handle(), called once per
//   idle tick (see mobile.c).
//
// Authorize is meant to land *during* the PPP session, right after the game
//   connects to a mail port and before it starts the actual SMTP/POP3
//   exchange -- that's the entire point of a "please authorize this device
//   before it's about to send/fetch mail" side channel. So, unlike the
//   relay number-fetch background task, resolution is NOT restricted to
//   idle time between sessions: it runs as soon as a connection slot is
//   actually free, via mobile_commands_connection_new() (see commands.h)
//   -- the same accounting the game's own connections use, so this can
//   never collide with (or steal) a connection the game already has open.
//   With only MOBILE_MAX_CONNECTIONS slots, that means device-auth may
//   have to wait a tick or two for one to free up; it stays pending, not
//   dropped, until it gets a turn.
// It IS still mutually exclusive with the number-fetch background task
//   (see mobile.c): both alias the same shared dns/relay socket buffer for
//   their own protocol state, which number-fetch is allowed to hold onto
//   for its whole (idle-only) run.
